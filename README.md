# distributed-objects
Repository for storing academic activities in programming with distributed objects with the C and Java language. 

In this repository, only the weeks whose activity involves coding are inserted, each week "Semana" is accompanied by a "Enunciado" containing the challenge, and also the files necessary to complete the activity, in addition to the code itself.

Weeks whose activities did not involve coding were ignored, so they were not entered into the repository.
